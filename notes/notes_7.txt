reduce:
------
- reduce is a higher order function. it takes a function 
  as one of its arguments.
- mul is a function from a module called operator. 
  You can think of it as a wrapper for the operator '*'.
- reduce(binary_function, sequence_of_elements[, Seed: base_case_if_seq_is_empty)]

- Note that the initialization is optional. If it's present, 
  it will be placed before the items of the iterable in the calculations. 
  if it's not, and the iterable contains one item, it will return this one item.

  reduce_for_range (bf, a, v) demands a be indexable.
  reduce_for (bf, a, v) does NOT demand a to be indexable. It should only be iterable.
 
  reduce(add,[],0] #0
  reduce(add,[])
  error: no initial value

  e.g., reduce(mul, range(1, 4), 1)
  1*1*2*3
  e.g., reduce(add, range(1,5), 1) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 

  write the function reduce: reduce(bf, iterable, seed) 


- reduce_for_range (bf, a, v) :
  demands "a" to be indexable

- reduce_for (bf, a, v) :
  demands "a" to be an iterable

- reduce_while (bf, a, v) :
  receives an iterable and generates an iterator
