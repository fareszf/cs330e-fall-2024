Introduction to iterables (iteration.py): 
------------------------
Iterables:
- an iterable is an object that you can iterate through.
- iterables usually have the property "__getitem__" 
  that indicates an object is indexable.

>>> x=[2, 3, 4]
>>> hasattr(x, "__iter__")
True
>>> hasattr(x, "__getitem__")
True
>>> hasattr(x, "__next__")
False

Iterators vs generators:
- an iterator object is an object that has the "__iter__" and "__next__" attributes.
- you can get an iterator out of an iterable using the iter function.
- generator functions allow you to declare a function that behaves like an iterator, 
  i.e. it can be used in a for loop.
- every generator is an iterator.

iter(): takes an iterable object and returns an iterator.
>>> x=[2, 3, 4]
>>> p = iter(x)
>>> next(p)
2
>>> next(p)
3
>>> next(p)
4
>>> next(p)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration

Generators:
----------

yield:
------
Yield:
e.g., 1
>>>def f() :
>>>    print("abc")
>>>    return 5
>>>    print ("def") # it does not make sense to have code 
                     # after return unless there is a condition before return.

>>>v = f()
abc
>>>print(v)
5
-------------------------------
e.g., 2
>>>def f() :
>>>    print("abc")
>>>    yield 5
>>>    print("def")
>>>    yield 6

>>>v = f()
>>>print(v)
<generator object f at 0x0096E8A0>
>>>print(hasattr(v, "__next__"))
True
>>>w = next(v)
abc
>>>print(w)
5
>>>w = next(v) # function starts running from where it left off
def
>>>print(w)
6
>>> w = next(v) # raises an exception
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration
>>>print(w)
6
------------------------------------------

>>>def f () :
>>>	print("abc")
>>>	yield 5
>>>	print("def")
>>>	yield 6
>>>	print("ghi")

>>>v = f()     # <nothing>
>>>print(v)    
<generator object f at .....>
>>>w = next(v) 
abc
>>>print(w)    
5
>>>x = next(v) 
def
>>>print(x)   
6
>>>y = next(v) 
ghi 
raise StopIteration

Lambda and zip
--------------
Lambda is an anonymous function that can be created at runtime. 
Anonymous means that it should not be bound to a name.

>>> def f (x):
...     return x**2
>>> g = lambda x: x**2
>>>
>>> f(3) == g(3)
True
Note that the lambda definition does not include a "return" statement -- 
it always contains an expression which is returned.

Syntax:
lambda arg1, arg2, ...argN : expression using arguments
>>> f = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z
>>> f(1, 2, 3)
6
>>>

Zip:
zip is a generator that combines two objects in a tuple.

>>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> b = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> c = zip(a, b)
>>> c
<zip object at 0x01939440>
>>> list(c)
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c'), (4, 'd')]
>>> list(c)
[]

----------
map function:
------------
map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)

Example
>>> items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, items))
>>> squared
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
>>>


----------
RMSE:
----------
Other implementations using zip, map, lambda.
(1) rmse_range_for: indexing
(2) rmse_zip_for: improvements: iterates through tuples
              zip: it combines two objects in a tuple.
              z is iterable over iterables of lenght 2.
              zip is a generator.
(3) rmse_zip_reduce: defines a function on the fly (Lambda: special keyword to define functions).
* reduce takes three arguments:
		 1) binary function (replaced by lambda)
		 2) sequence(iterable) (z)
		 3) seed (0)
reduce(sub, [2, 3, 4], 1]
1 sub 2 = -1
-1 sub 3 = -4
-4 sub 4 = -8

reduce(lambda u, w : u + (w[0] - w[1]) ** 2, z, 0)
func = lambda u, w : u + (w[0] - w[1]) ** 2
initially:
z=[(x0,y0),(x1,y1), ..., (xn,yn)] 
0 func (x0,y0) --> result1
result1 func (x1,y1) --> result2
....
(4) rmse_zip_map_sum: map: takes two parameters:
			   (1) a unary function
			   (2) a list (or iterable) to iterate through
	              map iterates through the elements of the second parameter and apply the function.
   		      map is a generator.
		      map is a unary function, reduce is a binary function

>>> a = [2, 3, 4]
>>> m = map(lambda v: v**2, a)
>>> print(m) # m is a generator
<map object at 0x00623F90>
>>> print(list(m))
[4, 9, 16]
>>>

Note: motivation for using map. if you have a list of numbers and want to double the numbers. 
you need to construct a loop and apply a function, double to every element in the list.
 With map, we only need map(double, list)	
(5) rmse_zip_list_sum  
Difference between (5) and (4) is that sum is eager but map is lazy. 
In the lazy case, small machine is built to produce values O(1) space, 
in the eager case, all values are generated O(n) space.
>>> b = [v ** 2 for v in a] # with [ ] we have a list (eager)
>>> b
[4, 9, 16]

(6) rmse_zip_generator_sum
>>> c = (v ** 2 for v in a) # with ( ) we have a generator (lazy)
>>> c
<generator object <genexpr> at 0x0061EAE0>
>>> list(c)
[4, 9, 16]

(7) rmse_map_sum: map is different here. It is binary (not unary). 
it applies its first argument(function) to the two parameters which are iterables. 
(close to what zip do?) Lazily build a generator.
>>> from numpy import add
>>> map(add, [2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7])
<map object at 0x008ABB90>
>>> m = map(add, [2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7])
>>> m
<map object at 0x008B6070>
>>> list(m)
[7, 9, 11]

(8) rmse_numpy
sqrt(mean(square(subtract(a, p))))

a,p are two iterables
